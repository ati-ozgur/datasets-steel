  abstract  = {The development of strategies for sequencing slabs through the reheat furnace and rolling mill of a modern steel manufacturing system is complicated by multiple and often conflicting objectives. For example, optimal energy efficiency through the reheat furnace may lead to inefficient rolling sequences or a less than desirable product delivery schedule. Thus, not only the model formulation is complicated, but also the combinatorial nature of the problem precludes an optimal solution. To address these complexities, an agent-oriented approach that has originated from distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is proposed here. It is found that the implementation of agent technology in the steel manufacturing system makes the operations more flexible, economical and energy efficient.},

  abstract  = {A fuzzy C-means clustering and constraint programming based multi-objective optimization decomposition algorithm for the hot rolling planning problem is presented. The slabs of a turn are divided into several clusters by fuzzy C-means clustering; sequence of slabs within each cluster and sequence of clusters are determined by constraint programming; the overall plan is obtained by integrating the sequence of slabs in accordance with the sequence of clusters. Computational experiments based on production data and random data show that the proposed algorithm performs well both in efficiency and effectiveness.},
